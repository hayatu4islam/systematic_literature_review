However, current research reveals some problems such as low accuracy of fault detection, few effective in-depth calculation of vibration data and few flexible architectures in that area. In this paper, a vibration fault detection Cyber-Physical System (CPS)with service support (S-VFDCPS) is presented. From the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) point of view, S-VFDCPS consists of enterprise level, gateway level and endpoint level, with relevant vibration detection services on each level. From the Cyber-Physical system (CPS) point of view, it contains three layers: the monitoring and control layer, the network layer and the device layer. Data processing algorithms and services are proposed quantifying the criteria of fault evaluation. It is shown by testing results that our proposed approach and the improvement in design make S-VFDCPS more flexible and accurate in real-time vibration fault detection.",,978-1-7281-4566-2,10.1109/IICSPI48186.2019.9095903,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9095903,Vibration fault detection;cyber-physical system (CPS);serice-oriented architecture (SOA);vibration data processing,Vibrations;Fault detection;Monitoring;Service-oriented architecture;Data processing;Logic gates;Computer architecture,cyber-physical systems;data analysis;fault diagnosis;service-oriented architecture;vibrational signal processing,service support;fault evaluation;vibration fault detection cyber-physical system;service-oriented architecture;enterprise level;gateway level;endpoint level;monitoring and control layer;network layer;device layer;data processing;machine fault detection;vibration signal,,,,16,IEEE,19-May-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Once connected to the internet, they become prone to attacks and attackers can easily modify the data by tampering the data while passing through the network. Attacks on CPS may not only have financial impacts but also can be a threat to human lives involved. Thus, security of Cyber Physical System is essential. This paper proposes a concept for enhancing security of the Cyber Physical System through an anomaly detection system using behaviour analysis. The proposed system uses Kalman Filter, knowledge base and comparator model. Kalman filter will be used to predict estimated states. Knowledge base will be first trained using simulated data of the system including faulty data. Once the filter is tested and knowledge base is trained, real time data will be passed through the prediction system and the predicted estimates will be compared with the data stored in knowledge base using comparator to detect anomalies.

Synchrophasor systems, like Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), are a key element of smart grids. They have the capability to measure time-coherent phasors of a grid. The key advantage of PMUs is the fast sampling rate that they provide over traditional Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems which can be in the range of 30-120 samples/second. These higher sampling rates come at the cost of higher data quantities. Generating large amounts of data per day poses a challenge in making the most efficient use of information. In this paper, this problem has been addressed utilizing machine learning techniques, Logistic Regression Analysis, on PMU data. Identifying system anomalies in smart power grids is the primary focus of this paper. The standard IEEE 39 Bus system has been modified using the RT-LAB environment to generate faults and to produce synthetic synchrophasor data.

Process-Based Anomaly Detection and Analysis for Cyber-Physical System with MQTT Protocol,M. A. B. Ahmadon; S.

Our method performs relaxation on monitoring the data and focuses more on the relationship of the execution order of message passing between the devices in the MQTT-based network. First, we performed a ‘bird’s eye’ monitoring technique to discover the execution order of message passing in the MQTT network with process mining. Then, we grasp the structure of the process model with a tree model called a process tree. Using the process tree, we check the deviations of normal behavior’s process tree and the monitored behavior’s process tree. Since CPS is a closed-loop system and MQTT protocol has pre-specified execution, we can easily detect deviations in the process tree as an anomaly. However, it is still hard to perform forensic analysis. Next, we proposed a forensic analysis method, which comes as an advantage of this approach compared to the black-boxed detection method, such as machine learning. The process-based approach can backtrack message passing by traversing the process tree and identify the execution operator in the parent nodes to find affected devices and execution order related to the incident.

Self-adaptivity is essential for CPSoS because it works on both cyber and physical uncertainties in various environments.

An adaptation should be processed within a certain period and it should consider anomalies caused by system changes due to mechanical faults, cyber-attacks, or emergent behaviors. However, since existing adaptation approaches cannot fully handle both aspects, this paper proposes an advanced approach, A4, for a self-adaptive system that can handle known anomalies in runtime.

As for our research platform, we employ the GVR-BOT unmanned ground vehicle, which is a replicate of the U.S. Army ground robot. We focus our study on the ability of the ground robot to operate under fault-tolerant conditions, making it challenging from the standpoint of cybersecurity to differentiate between legitimate and malicious operations. The GVR-BOT ground vehicle belongs to a class of differential drive ground robots and employs ROS in its onboard computer to interact with users. To facilitate deep learning, we develop a large database of images based on the network-traffic data of ROS, describing the dynamics of the GVR-BOT ground robot under legitimate and malicious operations.

This paper proposes an advanced fast density peak outlier detection algorithm based on the characteristics of big data. The algorithm is an outlier detection method based on the improved density peak clustering algorithm. This paper improves the original algorithm. From the perspective of outlier detection, although it is a clustering idea, it avoids the clustering process, reduces the time complexity of the cluster-based outlier detection algorithm, and absorbs. The outlier detection based on neighbors is not sensitive to data dimensions and other advantages. In the power industry, outlier detection can be used in areas such as grid fault detection, equipment fault detection, and power abnormality detection. The simulation experiment of outlier detection based on the daily load curve of single and multiple transformers in a certain province shows that the improved algorithm can effectively detect outliers in the data.","density clustering, KNN algorithm, big data, Outlier detection",,,,,,,,,,,

In order to detect potential faults, data from the in-vehicle network interconnecting vehicle subsystems is recorded during road trials. The complexity and volume of this data keeps increasing since the degree of interconnection between the vehicle subsystems and the amount of data transmitted over the in-vehicle network is augmented with each functionality added to modern vehicles. In this paper, an anomaly detection approach is proposed that (a) is capable of detecting faults of known and previously unknown fault types, (b) functions as an out-of-the-box approach not requiring the setting of expert-parameters and (c) is robust against different driving scenarios and fault types. To achieve this, an ensemble classifier is used consisting of two-class and one-class classifiers. Without modelling effort and user parameterisation the approach reports anomalies in the multivariate time series which point the expert to potential faults. The approach is validated on recordings from road trials and it could be shown that the ensemble-anomaly detector is robust against different driving scenarios and fault types.","Vehicle electronics, One-class classification, Ensemble methods, Fault detection, Anomaly detection",,,,,,,,,,,

The ability to efficiently and accurately classify the fault categories based on sensor signals is the key to successful bearing fault diagnosis. Although various data-driven methods have been developed for fault diagnosis in recent years, automatic and effective extraction of discriminative fault features from high-noise vibration signals generated in the real-world industrial environment remains a challenging task. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel deep learning method based on the combination of residual building Unit, soft thresholding and global context, called RSG, to solve the complex mapping relationship between vibration signals and different types of bearing faults. The proposed RSG integrates the working mechanisms of soft threshold and global context to achieve effective noise reduction and feature extraction. A comparative analysis is performed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. Furthermore, the proposed method is tested on a faulty motor dataset collected by our developed intelligent motor test platform based on Industrial Internet of Things.

By using the variational Bayesian inference, the states, the scale matrix, and the dof parameter are estimated simultaneously. Since the noise distribution is no longer the Gaussian, a modified residual evaluation is proposed to detect the fault. After that, the cause of fault can be determined by observing the changes on measurement noise covariance.

Examples include drone swarms, self-driving vehicles, autonomous robots, etc. Testing such systems poses numerous challenges: not only should the system inputs be varied, but also the surrounding environment should be accounted for. A number of tools have been developed to test the system model for the possible inputs falsifying its requirements. However, they are not directly applicable to autonomous cyberphysical systems, as the inputs to their models are generated while operating in a virtual environment. Aims: In this paper, we aim to design a search-based framework, named AmbieGen, for generating diverse fault-revealing test scenarios for autonomous cyberphysical systems. The scenarios represent an environment in which an autonomous agent operates. The framework should be applicable to generating different types of environments. Methods: To generate the test scenarios, we leverage the NSGA-II algorithm with two objectives. The first objective evaluates the deviation of the observed systems behaviour from its expected behaviour. The second objective is the test case diversity, calculated as a Jaccard distance with a reference test case. To guide the first objective we are using a simplified system model rather than the full model. The full model is used to run the system in the simulation environment and can take substantial time to execute (several minutes for one scenario). The simplified system model is derived from the full model and can be used to get an approximation of the results obtained from the full model without running the simulation. Results: We evaluate AmbieGen on three scenario generation case studies, namely a smart-thermostat, a robot obstacle avoidance system, and a vehicle lane-keeping assist system. For all the case studies, our approach outperforms the available baselines in fault revealing and several other metrics such as the diversity of the revealed faults and the proportion of valid test scenarios. Conclusion: AmbieGen could find scenarios, revealing failures for all the three autonomous agents considered in our case studies. We compared three configurations of AmbieGen: based on a single objective genetic algorithm, multi-objective, and random search. Both single and multi objective configurations outperform the random search. Multi objective configuration can find the individuals of the same quality as the single objective, producing more unique test scenarios in the same time budget. Our framework can be used to generate virtual environments of different types and complexity and reveal the systems faults early in the design stage.",Cyberphysical systems; Test scenario generation; Genetic algorithms; Virtual environments,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, the diagnostic systems are provided with a number of sensory inputs that introduce variations in input space which causes difficulty for the algorithms in edge devices. This issue is generally dealt with bi-view cross-domain learning approach. We propose a soft real-time fault diagnosis system for edge devices using domain adaptation training strategy. The investigation is carried out using deep learning models that can learn representations irrespective of input dimensions.

Currently, several machine learning and deep learning-based modules have achieved excellent results in fault detection and diagnosis. Nevertheless, to further increase user adoption and diffusion of such technologies, users and human experts must be provided with explanations and insights by the modules. Another issue is related, in most cases, with the unavailability of labeled historical data that makes the use of supervised models unfeasible. Therefore, a new approach for fault detection and diagnosis in rotating machinery is here proposed. The methodology consists of three parts: feature extraction, fault detection and fault diagnosis. In the first part, the vibration features in the time and frequency domains are extracted. Secondly, in the fault detection, the presence of fault is verified in an unsupervised manner based on anomaly detection algorithms. The modularity of the methodology allows different algorithms to be implemented. Finally, in fault diagnosis, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), a technique to interpret black-box models, is used. Through the feature importance ranking obtained by the model explainability, the fault diagnosis is performed. Two tools for diagnosis are proposed, namely: unsupervised classification and root cause analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown on three datasets containing different mechanical faults in rotating machinery. The study also presents a comparison between models used in machine learning explainability: SHAP and Local Depth-based Feature Importance for the Isolation Forest (Local-DIFFI). Lastly, an analysis of several state-of-art anomaly detection algorithms in rotating machinery is included.",Anomaly detection; Explainable artificial intelligence; Fault detection; Fault diagnosis; Rotating machinery; Condition monitoring,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It offers promising perspectives for high reliability, availability, maintainability and safety production process, but also makes the systems more complex and challenging for health assessment. To deal with these challenges, one needs to develop a robust approach to monitor and assess the system health state. In this paper, a practical and effective method that can be applied for fault detection and diagnostics of a given system is developed. The proposed method relies on a pattern recognition technique based on the construction of a new health indicator. This health indicator, which can be applied to different types of sensor measurements, is fed to an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to detect the health states of the system and diagnose the causes.

Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been successfully applied to fault diagnosis tasks and achieved promising results. However, one is that two datasets (in source and target domains) of similar tasks are with different feature distributions because of different operational conditions; another one is that insufficient or unlabeled data in real industry applications (target domains) limit the adaptability of the source domain well-defined models. To solve the above problems, the concept of transfer learning should be adopted for domain adaptation, in the meantime, a network performs both supervised and unsupervised learning is required. Inspired by Wasserstein distance of optimal transport, in this paper, we propose a novel Wasserstein Distance-based Deep Transfer Learning (WD-DTL) network for both supervised and unsupervised fault diagnosis tasks. WD-DTL learns domain feature representations (generated by a CNN based feature extractor) and minimizes distributions between the source and target domains through an adversarial training process. The effectiveness of the proposed WD-DTL is verified through 16 different transfer tasks. Results show that WD-DTL achieves the highest diagnostic accuracies when compared to the existing Maximum Mean Discrepancy and CNN networks in almost all transfer tasks.",Transfer learning; Domain adaptation; Wasserstein distance; Convolutional neural networks; Intelligent fault diagnosis,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such systems incorporate multiple layers and complex structure of hardware, software, analytical algorithms, business knowledge and communication networks, and operate under noisy and dynamic conditions. Thus, large-scale CPSs are vulnerable to enormous technical and operational challenges that may compromise the quality of data of their applications and accordingly reduce the quality of their services.

To overcome these obstacles, we propose a novel two-part approach: a stacked wavelet auto-encoder structure with a Morlet wavelet function for multisensory data fusion and a flexible weighted assignment of fusion strategies. Taking a planetary gearbox as an example, we use noisy vibration signals from multisensors to test the diagnosis performance of the proposed approach.

This paper develops a new framework based on privacy reinforcement learning to accurately identify anomalous patterns in a distributed and heterogeneous energy environment. The local outlier factor is first performed to derive the local simple anomalous patterns in each site of the distributed energy platform. A reinforcement privacy learning is then established using blockchain technology to merge the local anomalous patterns into global complex anomalous patterns. Besides, different optimization strategies are suggested to improve the whole outlier detection process. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, intensive experiments have been carried out on well-known CASAS (Center of Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems) platform.

Objective: We profile fault identification and diagnosis techniques employed in the aerospace, automotive, and industrial control domains. Each of these sectors has adopted particular methods to meet their differing diagnostic needs. By examining both theoretical presentations as well as case studies from production environments, we present a profile of the current approaches being employed and identify gaps. Methodology: A scoping study was used to identify and compare fault detection and diagnosis methodologies that are presented in the current literature. We created categories for the different diagnostic approaches via a pilot study and present an analysis of the trends that emerged. We then compared the maturity of these approaches by adapting and using the NASA Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale. Results: Fault identification and analysis studies from 127 papers published from 2004 to 2019 reveal a wide diversity of promising techniques, both emerging and in-use. These range from traditional Physics-based Models to Data-Driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Knowledge-Based approaches. Hybrid techniques that blend aspects of these three broad categories were also encountered. Predictive diagnostics or prognostics featured prominently across all sectors, along with discussions of techniques including Fault trees, Petri nets and Markov approaches. We also profile some of the techniques that have reached the highest Technology Readiness Levels, showing how those methods are being applied in real-world environments beyond the laboratory. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the continuing wide use of both Model-Based and Data-Driven AI techniques across all domains, especially when they are used together in hybrid configuration, reflects the complexity of the current ICPS application space. While creating sufficiently-complete models is labor intensive, Model-free AI techniques were evidenced as a viable way of addressing aspects of this challenge, demonstrating the increasing sophistication of current machine learning systems. Connecting ICPS together to share sufficient telemetry to diagnose and manage faults is difficult when the physical environment places demands on ICPS.

While many studies were conducted to tackle the challenge of sensor nodes failure detection using domain-specific solutions, this paper proposes a novel sensor nodes failure detection approach and empirically evaluates its validity using a real-world case study.

Three different time-series clustering techniques have been investigated using real-world observations collected from two various sensor node networks, one of which consists of 275 temperature sensors distributed around London. This study demonstrates that time-series clustering effectively detects sensor nodes continuous (halting/repeating) and incipient faults. It also showed that the feature-based time series clustering technique is a more efficient long-segmental outliers detection mechanism compared to shape-based time-series clustering techniques such as DTW and K-Shape, mainly when applied to shorter time-series windows.",Cyberphysical systems (CPSs); Wireless sensor networks(WSNs); Time-series clustering; Dynamic time warping; K-shape; Characteristics based time-series clustering,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various software fault-tolerant techniques are employed towards this goal among which check-pointing is a relatively cost-effective scheme. In this paper, we propose an efficient fault-tolerant scheduling framework with run-time fault handling protocol, where criticality levels can be adaptively inserted for fault handling according to run-time fault workload. In contrast to prior works which apply with task re-execution strategy, the proposed framework adaptively determines on-demand re-executions only on the faulty checkpoint segments, rather than on the whole job. Towards this, a unified overrun handling protocol is developed to handle fault recovery adaptively to avoid over-provisioning of resources. In addition, we develop an off-line schedulability analysis technique for the proposed scheduling algorithm. The simulation results show that our fault-tolerant scheduling framework can bring up to 81% improvement in supporting low-criticality service without sacrifice in the MC-schedulability compared with the existing techniques.",Fault-tolerant scheduling; Run-time fault handling; Check-pointing; Safety-critical real-time system,,,,,,,,,,,,,
